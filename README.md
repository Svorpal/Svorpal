[[web](https://qd39l.github.io/HPP-cellular-automaton-FPGA/index.html) | [source code](https://github.com/qd39l/HPP-cellular-automaton-FPGA/tree/main/hpp_automata_src) | [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQd6q0IsZMc)]

- Designed from scratch a particle simulator (HPP cellular automaton) and implemented on a DE1-SoC FPGA
- Implementation of HPP cellular automaton in Verilog that supports simultaneous simulation of up to 1.2 million particles at 60 frames per second with 640 by 480 VGA output
- Developed C program for handling mouse inputs and control signals for FPGA
- Achieved >10X times speedup and >60X energy efficiency compared to software C (no video rendering) running on Apple M1 Max SoC
