# My projects
### FPGA-accelerated Boid Algorithm Simulation on VGA (2023)
[[web](https://svorpal.github.io/FPGA_website/) 
Using a combination of the ARM A9 processor and DE1 SoC FPGA, our project successfully simulated dynamic boid (â€˜bird-oid object') flocking patterns, with a focus on optimizing cycle requirements and execution time

### Fast robot (2023)
[[web](https://svorpal.github.io/fast_robot_website/) 
A fast robot car with stunting, mapping, and localization abilities, controlled remotely via Bluetooth. Software is programming in C++ running on a SparkFun Artemis Nano board.

### Bike Simulation Multiplayer Game(2022)
[[web](https://github.com/Svorpal/BikeSimu) 
Freeride is a mountain bike simulation that provides an engaging and interactive gaming experience for bikers and adventurers alike! The game incorporates computer vision-based pose detection coupled with a custom wireless controller constructed using real mountain bike handlebars to create a sense of realistic steering in-game. The game may also be controlled using a traditional keyboard setup. To win, the player must navigate down a treacherous mountain terrain through highlighted rings before time runs out!
